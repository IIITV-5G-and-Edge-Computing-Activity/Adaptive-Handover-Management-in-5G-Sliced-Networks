# Algorithm for Slice Handover in 5G Networks

This repository implements an algorithm for optimizing slice handovers in 5G networks. The algorithm aims to ensure seamless connectivity, optimize resource allocation, and maintain Quality of Service (QoS) during inter-slice handovers.

## Instalation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:

```
### Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd Adaptive-Handover-Management-in-5G-Sliced-Networks
```

### Execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Features
1. Adaptive Handover Mechanism: Implements algorithms that adaptively manage handovers based on network conditions.
2. Network Slicing: Supports multiple virtual networks on a single physical infrastructure, optimizing resource utilization.
3. Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of handover management strategies.
